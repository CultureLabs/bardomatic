This is a [PyBossa app](http://dev.pybossa.com/) for deployment on [CrowdCrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org/).

Try it out: just open `index.html` in your browser and try it out.

Things to do / improve:

* Deply on crowdcrafting (will need to mess around with scripts as some stuff is local ...)
* Styling
* Tell people whether they were right or wrong
* Fix source tasks to have "play" attribute rather than "play "
