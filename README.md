Simple game in which you are presented with a short excerpt from a Shakespeare Play and you have to guess which play it is (and who's speaking).

This has been built as a [PyBossa app](http://dev.pybossa.com/) for deployment on [CrowdCrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org/) but it will also run locally (though you'll then be anonymous and won't get any credits for your brilliant answers!).

Try it out: just open `index.html` in your browser and try it out.

Things to do / improve:

* Deply on crowdcrafting (will need to mess around with scripts as some stuff is local ...)
* Styling
* Tell people whether they were right or wrong
* Fix source tasks to have "play" attribute rather than "play "
